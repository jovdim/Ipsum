CREATING Constructors:

Constructor method are named after their Class Name.

modifiers className class{

//constructor is a method. special method
    className(){
     //constructor
    }
}

public Product class{

//this is called attribute.
    String name;
    float price;

    Product(String name, float price){
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;

    }

}


THIS keyword:

the this keyword refers to the class itself. The this keyword will enables you to access global variables inside the class if you have the same variable names in a parameter.

Product pl = new product("Milk", 250, of);
Product p2 = new Product("Noodles",15.25f);
Product p3 = new Product("Softdrinks",12.50f);
