OVERLOADING CONSTRUCTORS.


~Overloading Constructors = it is an oop technique  used to create multiple constructors with different arguments, it is used to cope up with the needs of certain instance of an object.

it is like Method OverLoading.

Create Multiple Methods w/ the Class Name and w/ Different Arguments

modifiers class className{
//attributes

    className(arguments){


    }

    className(arguments){


    }

} 

example:

 class Employee{
//attributes

    Employee(arguments){


    }

    Employee(arguments){


    }

} 

it have double constructors which is valid to class object too. as long as it has different parameters/arguments else it will get error.
