ABSTRACTION

Abstraction = it is an oop technique that hides certain details and only shows the important information.

it can be achieved in 2 ways:
- Abstract Classes (Uses abstract modifier)
- Interfaces (Uses implements keyword)

ABSTRACT Class = it cannot be instantiated, to access it you need to inherit it from another class.

ABSTRACT Methods = It can only be declared inside an abstract class it is a Method without a body and it needs to be overriden in the subclass of the abstract class.

USING Abstraction(Abstract classes)

abstract class Animal{

    abstract void makeSound();

}

class Dog extends Animal{

    void makeSound(){

    System.out.println("Arf");
    }

}

class Cat extends Animal{

    void makeSound(){

    System.out.println("Meow");
