POLYMORPHISM

polymorphism = "Poly" means MANY and Morph means "Take Different Forms".
It is an oop technique that utilizes inheritance to create 1 class and make several classes inheritance to create 1 class and make several classes inherit from that class so that it can take many forms.


USING Polymorphism

//this will be the superclass(parent class) because as you can see the Animal word is general.; 
class Animal{

    void makeSound(){
    //Sound
    }
}

//this is the subclass of the Animal
class Dog extends Animal{

    void makeSound(){
    //arf
    }
}


//this is the subclass of the Animal
class Cat extends Animals{

    void makeSound(){

    //meow
    }
}
