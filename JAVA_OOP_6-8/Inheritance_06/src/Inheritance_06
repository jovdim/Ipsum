~Inheritance = it is oop technique used to inherit attributes and methods from one CLASS TO ANOTHER. 

~Superclass = it is the class where we will inherit the attributes and methods(parent class)
~Subclass = it is the class who will inherit the attributes and methods from a superclass(parent class).subclass it the child class.

~EXTENDS  = it is used after the class name and it indicates that the certain class will inherit from another class.

modifiers class subClassName extends superClassName {

//Attributes & Methods

}

example:

class Person {
String name,sex;
int age;


//Methods
}


//the Person class is inherited in toddler class so what ever Person class has, toddler as it too now. 
class toddler extends Person{

    void drink(){

    //Print "Drinking Milk"
    }
}

OVERRIDING Constructors = you are required to call the constructor of the superclass

class person{

        person(arguments){
        //constructors
        }
}

class toddler extends person{
        
        toddler(arguments){
        super(arguments);
//add attributes 
        }


}

SUPER keyword = it can only be used by a subclass(child) and it is used to call their superclass so we can access their constructors, attributes and methods.

OVERRIDING methods = to retain the Functionality from the Super Class use the Super Keyword w/ the Method name.

class person{
    void checkStatus(){

    //output attributes
    }
}

class toddler extendes person{

void checkStatus(){
super checkStatus();
//add Functionalities
}
}
