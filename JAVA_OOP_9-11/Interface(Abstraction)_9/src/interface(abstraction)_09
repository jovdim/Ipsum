-USING Abstraction (Interface)


ABSTRACTION = it is an oop technique that hides certain details and only shows the important information.

It can be achieved in 2 ways:
- Abstract Classes (Uses abstract modifier)
- Interfaces (Uses implements keyword)

INTERFACE = It is a full Abstract Class that is implemented in other classes.
Any method you declare would be an abstract method by default you an use the default modifier to create a method with body the method would be static.
Any variable that you declare would be static and final.

IMPLEMENTS Keyword = it is used after the class name so that we can implement an interface in that certain class.
Implemented interface requires the class to override every method inside the interface.
We can implement 1 or more interfaces in each class.

interface Animal{

    void makeSound();

}

class Dog implements Animal{
    void makeSound(){
    //arf
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal{
    void makeSound(){
    //meow
    }
}

//WHEN USING INTERFACES THE INSTANCES NAME SHOULD NOT BE SAME LIKE WE DOIN IN INHERIT. THE POLYMORPHISM SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED.
