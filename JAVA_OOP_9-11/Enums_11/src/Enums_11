ENUMS

enum is short for enumerators
~Enum = it is a Special Class that contains a collection of constant values.
They can represent words as Objects.

USING ENUMS = AILEVEL level = AILevel.HARD;


//when using conditional we can only use equal. so better to use switch case.
ENUMS IN CONDITIONAL STATEMENT;

AILevel level = AILevel.HARD;

if(level == AILevel.EASY){

}else if(level == AILevel.MEDIUM){

}else if(level == AILevel.HARD){

}

//this is for switch cases
//so we can decide which one we want

   switch (level) {
            case EASY:
                break;
            case MEDIUM:
                break;
            case HARD:
                break;

        }


DECLARING Enums w/ Values

enum USCurrency {

    PENNY(O.01f), NICKLE(O.O5f), DIME(O.1f), QUARTER(O.25f);
    float val;

    USCurrency(float val){
    this.val = val;
    }
}
